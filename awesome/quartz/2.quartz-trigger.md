## trigger

### introduce

1. The trigger must have unique withIdentity, it's to say, cannot has same name and group-name at same time.
   - if donot provided, quartz will allocate uuid to name and value
2. Many Triggers can point to the same Job detail, but a single Trigger can only point to one Job detail.
3. If Trigger is linked for job by `.forJob(str, str)`, it can be triggerred by scheduler without specify job arg:

   - job must be must `.storeDurably(true)`
   - job must be added to scheduler before.
   - Trigger must call `.forJob(str, str)` method.

4. If the JobDetail is triggered, it can call `.scheduler.scheduleJob(newTrigger)` directly.
5. If the JobDetail is triggered by `scheduler.scheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger)`, so when another trigger cannot trig in this way. <br>
   - And must use `scheduler.scheduleJob(trigger);` method.

### cron expression

1. introduce: year can be omitted

2. `*` means match any value
3. `?` just can be used in `day, week`, means it donot what's value. such as `* * * 15 * ? *` it's not clearly _what day of the week_ is the 15th of each month

   - 这个 `?` 表示不确定的值, 比如上面的例子中 不确定每个月的 15 号是星期几, 所以就写 `?` 里表示星期不参与[星期无关]

4. `-` is range:

   - `5-10 * * * * ? *`: Execute every 5-10 seconds every minute， 6 times.
   - `10-5 * * * * ? *`: Execute every 10-60, 0-5 seconds every minute， 56 times.

5. `,` is specified multi value

   - `5,10,11 * * * * ? *`: Execute every 5, 10, 11 seconds every minute， 3 times.

6. `/`: used to specify increments.

   - `1/5 * * * * ? *`: Execute from 1s[excute], and each 5s will execute.
   - `0/5 * * * * ? *` is same as `*/5 * * * * ? *`: Execute from 0s[excute], and each 5s will execute.
   - `*/40 * * * * ? *`： Execute each 0s, 40s
   - `45/40 * * * * ? *`： Execute each 45s

7. `L`: jsu can be used in `day, week`, last

   - `* * * L * ? *`: execute in last day of each month
   - `* * * L-3 * ? *`： execute in (last day - 3d) per month
   - `* * * 1-3,L-3 * ? *`: `invalid`
   - `* * * ? * L *`: execute in SAT of each week
   - `* * * ? * 3L *`: execute in third SAT of each week

8. `W`: just can used in `weekday`,

   - `* * * 15W * ? *`: execute in weekday which is nearest to 15th per month and donot work in two month
   - `* * * 1W * ? *`: execute in in first weekday per month, even though 1th is SAT, which nearest weekday is last month's Fri.
   - `* * * 1-4W * ? *`: `invalid`, The 'W' character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.

9. `LW`: just can used in `day`

   - `* * * LW * ? *`: means the last weekday of month

10. `#`: just can used in `week`, This character is used to specify **the nth** XXX day of the month

    - `* * * ? * 6#3 *`: execute in third Fri day per month
    - `* * * ? * 6#8 *`: execute in 8th Fri day per month, it's means never execute
    - `* * * ? * 6#8,6#3 *`: invalid, it must single value when used.

11. `day` or `week` must has one is `?`, and **'?' can only be specified for Day-of-Month -OR- Day-of-Week.**
