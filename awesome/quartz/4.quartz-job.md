## job

1. requirement

   - must extands **org.quartz.job**
   - must have no-args constructor

2. get ioc bean in job, without using boot-stater

   - this xxJob is created by quartz job-detail, so it's not singleton
   - if need to obtain ioc bean, we can implement `SpringApplicationContextAware` to get `IOC Context` , then get bean

3. variables

   - Job can get args variable passed by Trigger and JobDetail according to JobDataMap
     ```java
     // no means, it will be overwritten by setJobData
     .usingJobData("age", 20)
     .setJobData(
           new JobDataMap(
              new HashMap<String, Object>(2) {
                 {
                 put("name", "zack1");
                 put("age", 18);
                 }
        }))
     ```
   - Trigger args has higher priority `getMegeredJobDataMap()`
   - if we define `variable in xJob and setXxx()`, and there `same name` args provided by Trigger or JonDetail, then quartz will assign value to it automatically
